# ML-Final-Project
***
In this repository, at the Phase01 folder, we have 3 variety VGG16 Model. First, we trrained the normal VGG16 which mentioned in <a href = "https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10/tree/master" target = "_self">this repository</a>
 and saved the codes, the notebook file and the URL of .pt files of this Normal Model. We tried this process for 2 different extension of normal VGG16. At the first extension, we trained a VGG16 Model Without Maxpooling layer and saved the necessary files. Finally at the second extension, we trained a VGG16 Model With Batch Normalization and saved the necessary files.
